## Project overview
This project involved the creation of a faux ecommerce site, which allowed a user to navigate between different pages,
and to filter between products of different categories. It also included a search bar, which needed to maintain its value
across different page changes, using a context to manage the state.

## Considerations
Due to the time constraints and wanting to focus on functionality tailwind was utilised for some aspects of layout, however modular SCSS was included at a component level.
Normally I would create a despoke design system based off of a Figma file and not use Tailwind.

Due to a lack of experience with Jest, which was not used at my previous place of employment, I was unable to include the testing aspects in the timeframe. Testing is something I have lined up in my Udemy course timeline.

## To run the project
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
